praise the Lord at all time for He is good.
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. 
Praise ye the LORD.Psalms 150:6 
But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, 
and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.Hebrews 11:6
